	abstract = {Optimal design and operation of multi-energy systems involving seasonal energy storage are often hindered by the complexity of the optimization problem. Indeed, the description of seasonal cycles requires a year-long time horizon, while the system operation calls for hourly resolution; this turns into a large number of decision variables, including binary variables, when large systems are analyzed. This work presents novel mixed integer linear program methodologies that allow considering a year time horizon with hour resolution while signiﬁcantly reducing the complexity of the optimization problem. First, the validity of the proposed techniques is tested by considering a simple system that can be solved in a reasonable computational time without resorting to design days. Findings show that the results of the proposed approaches are in good agreement with the full-scale optimization, thus allowing to correctly size the energy storage and to operate the system with a long-term policy, while signiﬁcantly simplifying the optimization problem. Furthermore, the developed methodology is adopted to design a multi-energy system based on a neighborhood in Zurich, Switzerland, which is optimized in terms of total annual costs and carbon dioxide emissions. Finally the system behavior is revealed by performing a sensitivity analysis on diﬀerent features of the energy system and by looking at the topology of the energy hub along the Pareto sets.},

	abstract = {We investigate the optimal operation of multi-energy systems deploying geothermal energy storage to deal with the seasonal variability of heating and cooling demands. We do this by developing an optimization model that improves on the state-of-the-art by accounting for the nonlinearities of the physical system, and by capturing both the short- and long-term dynamics of energy conversion, storage and consumption. The algorithm aims at minimizing the CO2 emissions of the system while satisfying the heating and cooling demands of given end-users, and it determines the optimal operation of the system, i.e. the mass flow rate and temperature of the water circulating through the network, accounting for the time evolution of the temperature of the geothermal fields. This optimization model is developed with reference to a real-world application, namely the Anergy Grid installed at ETH Zurich, in Switzerland. Here, centralized heating and cooling provision based on fossil fuels is complemented by a dynamic underground network connecting geothermal fields, acting as energy source and storage, and demand end-users requiring heating and cooling energy. The proposed optimization algorithm allows reducing the CO2 emissions of the university campus by up to 87\% with respect to the use of a con­ ventional system based on centralized heating and cooling. This improves on the 72\% emissions reduction achieved with the current operation strategies. Furthermore, the analysis of the system allows to derive design guidelines and to explain the rationale behind the operation of the system. The study highlights the importance of coupling daily and seasonal energy storage towards the achievement of low-carbon energy systems.},

	abstract = {The deployment of diverse energy storage technologies, with the combination of daily, weekly and seasonal storage dynamics, allows for the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per unit energy provided. In particular, the production, storage and re-utilization of hydrogen starting from renewable energy has proven to be one of the most promising solutions for offsetting seasonal mismatch between energy generation and con­ sumption. A realistic possibility for large-scale hydrogen storage, suitable for long-term storage dynamics, is presented by salt caverns. In this contribution, we provide a framework for modeling underground hydrogen storage, with a focus on salt caverns, and we evaluate its potential for reducing the CO2 emissions within an integrated energy systems context. To this end, we develop a first-principle model, which accounts for the transport phenomena within the rock and describes the dynamics of the stored energy when injecting and withdrawing hydrogen. Then, we derive a linear reduced order model that can be used for mixed-integer linear program optimization while retaining an accurate description of the storage dynamics under a variety of operating conditions. Using this new framework, we determine the minimum-emissions design and operation of a multi-energy system with H2 storage. Ultimately, we assess the potential of hydrogen storage for reducing CO2 emissions when different capacities for renewable energy production and energy storage are available, mapping emissions regions on a plane defined by storage capacity and renewable generation. We extend the analysis for solar- and wind-based energy generation and for different energy demands, representing typical profiles of electrical and thermal demands, and different CO2 emissions associated with the electric grid.},

	abstract = {In hydro-based power systems, the Generation Scheduling (GS) problem is usually divided into a series of coupled models aiming to obtain an optimal operating policy over a multi-year planning horizon. The mediumterm GS (MTGS) problem belongs to these models, linking the long-term GS (LTGS) with the short-term GS (STGS) problem. To carry out a proper coupling, we propose a stochastic MTGS model with a multi-period scenario tree with non-common samples, and hourly discretization in the first week to include the nonconvex thermal unit-commitment constraints. These considerations lead to solving a very challenging large-scale sto­ chastic optimization problem with mixed-binary variables in the first week. In this context, efficient solution techniques must be explored to ensure a suitable trade-off between solution accuracy and computational per­ formance. In this paper, we propose a two-stage decomposition for the MTGS that is solved by the extended level bundle method. Every second-stage subproblem is itself a multi-period stochastic problem involving only continuous variables. Numerical assessments on the large-scale Brazilian MTGS problem indicate that our approach significantly outperforms the Nested decomposition and Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) algorithm in terms of computational burden, providing CPU time reductions in the order of 19\%.},

The energy management system (EMS) plays a key role in the production of renewable hydrogen by controlling electrolyzer’s operating point to achieve operational and economical beneﬁts. In this regard, this article introduces the optimal scheduling for an EMS model for a hydrogen production system integrated with a photovoltaic (PV) system and a battery energy storage system (BESS) to satisfy electricity and hydrogen demands of an industrial hydrogen facility. The proposed EMS model aims to minimize the cost of hydrogen (CoH) production by minimizing the system net costs of industrial hydrogen facility while maintaining a reliable system operation. Furthermore, the proposed EMS model enables the application of seasonal hydrogen storage by incorporating the Z-score statistical measure of historical electricity prices, which follows seasonal electricity price trends. This allows the storage of hydrogen during periods of relatively low electricity prices. To demonstrate the validity of this model, it is tested for both intraseasonal and seasonal storage. Four case studies are used to prove the techno-economic beneﬁts of the proposed EMS model. Furthermore, the impact of the electrolyzer’s capacity factor, the size of the hydrogen storage, and the PV share is investigated in terms of their techno-economic beneﬁts to the system.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen production is the key in utilizing an excess renewable energy. Many studies and projects looked at the energy management systems (EMSs) that allow to couple hydrogen production with renewable generation. In the majority of these studies, however, hydrogen demand is either produced for powering fuel cells or sold to the external hydrogen market. Hydrogen demand from actual industrial plants is rarely considered. In this paper, we propose an EMS based on the industrial cluster of GreenLab Skive (GLS) that can minimize the system’s oper­ ational cost or maximize its green hydrogen production. EMS utilizes a conventional and P2X demand response (DR) flexibility from electrolysis plant, hydrogen storage tank, electric battery, and hydrogen-consuming plants to design the optimal schedule with maximized benefits. A potential addition to the existing components at GLS an ammonia plant is modelled to identify its P2X potential and assess the economic viability of its construction. The results show a potential reduction of 51.5–61.6\% for the total operational cost of the system and an increase of the share of green hydrogen by 10.4–37.6\% due to EMS operation.},

By comparing model results in terms of costs and installed capacities across different methods, this study shows that the best method depends heavily on input data and the setup of model constraints. This implies that there is no one-size-ﬁts-all approach to the problem of time step reduction, but heuristic approaches appear promising. In addition, the 25 years of time series demonstrate considerable inter-year variability in wind and PV power output. This further complicates the problem of time detail in energy models as it suggests long time series are necessary. Model results with high shares of PV and wind generation using a single or few years of data are likely unreliable. Better modeling and planning methods are required to determine robust scenarios with high shares of variable renewables. The methods are implemented in the freely available open-source modeling framework Calliope.},

	abstract = {Clustering non-Euclidean data is difficult, and one of the most used algorithms besides hierarchical clustering is the popular algorithm Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), also simply referred to as k-medoids clustering. In Euclidean geometry the mean – as used in k-means – is a good estimator for the cluster center, but this does not exist for arbitrary dissimilarities. PAM uses the medoid instead, the object with the smallest dissimilarity to all others in the cluster. This notion of centrality can be used with any (dis-)similarity, and thus is of high relevance to many domains and applications. A key issue with PAM is its high run time cost. We propose modifications to the PAM algorithm that achieve an O(k)-fold speedup in the second (‘‘SWAP’’) phase of the algorithm, but will still find the same results as the original PAM algorithm. If we relax the choice of swaps performed (while retaining comparable quality), we can further accelerate the algorithm by eagerly performing additional swaps in each iteration. With the substantially faster SWAP, we can now explore faster initialization strategies, because (i) the classic (‘‘BUILD’’) initialization now becomes the bottleneck, and (ii) our swap is fast enough to compensate for worse starting conditions. We also show how the CLARA and CLARANS algorithms benefit from the proposed modifications. While we do not study the parallelization of our approach in this work, it can easily be combined with earlier approaches to use PAM and CLARA on big data (some of which use PAM as a subroutine, hence can immediately benefit from these improvements), where the performance with high k becomes increasingly important. In experiments on real data with k = 100, 200, we observed a 458× respectively 1191× speedup compared to the original PAM SWAP algorithm, making PAM applicable to larger data sets, and in particular to higher k. © 2021 The Authors.

In this paper, focus on cases where long-term decisions have to be balanced with detailed short-term decisions to insure operational realism. On such problems, standard rolling horizon approaches are hard to solve due to the substantial increase of the temporal dimension. To overstep this issue, new approaches to balance short and long-term decisions. Two modelling approaches, based on aggregated time steps, are proposed and tested on an energy production problem where energy can be stored seasonally. Approaches are compared to benchmarks approaches (myopic and a posteriori optimization), and a sensitivity analysis is performed. Both approaches are promising and correspond to different compromises between the model complexity, computation times and solution quality.},

Where Smart Grids focus primarily on the electricity sector, Smart Energy Systems take an integrated holistic focus on the inclusion of more sectors (electricity, heating, cooling, industry, buildings and transportation) and allows for the identification of more achievable and affordable solutions to the transformation into future renewable and sustainable energy solutions. This paper first makes a review of the scientific literature within the field. Thereafter it discusses the term Smart Energy Systems with regard to the issues of definition, identification of solutions, modelling, and integration of storage. The conclusion is that the Smart Energy System concept represents a scientific shift in paradigms away from single-sector thinking to a coherent energy systems understanding on how to benefit from the integration of all sectors and infrastructures.}

abstract = {The integration of all sectors of energy production, distribution and consumption in multi-source energy networks has lately gained attention as an attractive strategy to deal with the challenges raised by decarbonization roadmaps. For such a network to become a smart energy system, however, it needs to be managed and controlled in a smart way. While existing techniques mainly focus either on short-term unit commitment or on yearly scheduling separately, this work presents an original combined optimization algorithm which merges the two methods, in order to enhance system real-time control with long-term evaluations (e.g. incentives and yearly constraints). The control architecture comprises three coordinated optimization levels, each periodically updated through the receding time horizon strategy. A long-term supervisory module performs whole-year optimal scheduling accounting for long-term factors and determines the constraints for a short-term supervisory module which, in turn, optimizes the control action for the energy production system in real-time. In parallel, energy distribution modules minimize energy supply to the different portions of the distribution network downstream. Simulation results on a hospital case study demonstrate a 9.7% reduction in total operating cost over the whole year, as well as an increase in revenues deriving from incentives for high efficiency cogeneration.}

abstract = {Seasonal storage is a key feature of future decarbonized energy systems with a high share of renewable energy integration. Power-to-Gas technologies represent a promising solution to enable such storage. They allow the conversion of surplus renewable electricity into e-fuels and their storage in the long-term. Their utilization enables the integration of the electrical, fuel and heating sectors, by converting electricity into fuels and recovering the waste heat from the process. Nevertheless, to design the most profitable management strategy for such systems, advanced control tools are required. This study introduces a novel control architecture for multiple multi-energy systems that share an e-fuel seasonal storage. Each energy system has its own short-term control logic, based on Model-Predictive Control (MPC), which manages day-ahead energy exchanges, while a long-term MPC controller considers yearly dynamics and the system as a whole. This gives additional constraints to the short-term controllers, which ensure the fulfillment of yearly goals. A multi-temporal and multi-spatial hierarchical control architecture is proposed, which enables optimal seasonal storage management, and its operation is verified in a Model-in-the-Loop configuration. The controller efficiently uses seasonal storage to balance seasonal mismatch between production and demand, resulting in higher utilization of renewable energy, lower emissions and costs.}

This comes with several modelling choices including simplified technological and economical models, temporal and spatial resolutions, or perfect foresight assumptions. On the basis of a single case study with complex decision making due to interdependent time scales, this paper shows the importance of evaluating and comparing the (cross-)impacts of the different modelling choices. The modelling choices tested are the inclusion of flexibility costs and constraints, the use of representative periods, the use of different methods to optimise operational decisions (including various rolling horizon methods), and the consideration of forecasts errors or not. The results illustrate the impact that flexibility costs and constraints can have and how they determine alternative modelling choices. They show under which condition representative periods can be used without introducing strong biases on the results. Finally, different rolling horizon strategies are compared, concluding on the validity of the perfect foresight assumption on the case. Results are discussed in terms of performance, validity, and computation times.},

The vast majority of the current approaches to select a representative set of days relies on either simple heuristics or clustering algorithms and comparison of different approaches is restricted to different clustering algorithms. This paper contributes by: i) proposing criteria and metrics for evaluating representativeness, ii) providing a novel optimization-based approach to select a representative set of days, and iii) evaluating and comparing the developed approach to multiple approaches available from the literature. The developed optimization-based approach is shown to achieve more accurate results than the approaches available from the literature. As a consequence, by applying this approach to select a representative set of days, the accuracy of ESOMs/GEPMs can be improved without increasing the computational cost. The main disadvantage is that the approach is computationally costly and requires an implementation effort.},

	abstract = {The intermittent nature of renewable energy resources such as wind and solar causes the energy supply to be less predictable leading to possible mismatches in the power network. To this end, hydrogen production and storage can provide a solution by increasing flexibility within the system. Stored hydrogen as compressed gas can either be converted back to electricity or it can be used as feed-stock for industry, heating for built environment, and as fuel for vehicles. This research is the first to examine optimal strategies for operating integrated energy systems consisting of renewable energy production and hydrogen storage with direct gas-based use-cases for hydrogen. Using Markov decision process theory, we construct optimal policies for day-to-day decisions on how much energy to store as hydrogen, or buy from or sell to the electricity market, and on how much hydrogen to sell for use as gas. We pay special emphasis to practical settings, such as contractually binding power purchase agreements, varying electricity prices, different distribution channels, green hydrogen offtake agreements, and hydrogen market price uncertainties. Extensive experiments and analysis are performed in the context of Northern Netherlands where Europe’s first Hydrogen Valley is being formed. Results show that gains in operational revenues of up to 51\% are possible by introducing hydrogen storage units and competitive hydrogen market-prices. This amounts to a €126,000 increase in revenues per turbine per year for a 4.5 MW wind turbine. Moreover, our results indicate that hydrogen offtake agreements will be crucial in keeping the energy transition on track.},

We give sufficient conditions for constructing formulations for these constraints with a number of binary variables and extra constraints logarithmic in the number of polyhedra. Using these conditions we introduce mixed integer binary formulations for {SOS}1 and {SOS}2 constraints that have a number of binary variables and extra constraints logarithmic in the number of continuous variables. We also introduce the first mixed integer binary formulations for piecewise linear functions of one and two variables that use a number of binary variables and extra constraints logarithmic in the number of linear pieces of the functions. We prove that the new formulations for piecewise linear functions have favorable tightness properties and present computational results showing that they can significantly outperform other mixed integer binary formulations.},

It especially raises technological issues to handle variability and to match electricity load with supply at all times. This study introduces a new methodology to quantify the relevance of different electricity storage technologies, based on a time scale analysis. It additionally provides an understanding of how electricity storages work in combination to handle variable load and intermittent generation. First, we set up a simple model of variable production, fluctuating over a single time-scale. This analysis provides figures of merit for electricity storage and curtailment. Second, we simulate the collaboration and competition behavior of various storages with a dual time-scale signal. Then, results are compared with the optimization of an energy system with real variable electricity supply and consumption time-series. We eventually highlight the trade-off mechanisms between the storage efficiency and its investment cost.}

Sophisticated predictive control schemes have recently been developed that achieve these gains by exploiting the energy generation, conversion, and storage equipment shared by the building community. A common difficulty with all these methods is integrating knowledge about the long term evolution of the disturbances affecting the system dynamics (e.g., ambient temperature and solar radiation). In this context, the seasonal storage capabilities of the system are difficult to be optimally managed. This letter addresses this issue by exploiting available historical data to: (i) construct bounds that confine with high probability the optimal charging trajectory of the seasonal storage and (ii) generate a piece-wise affine approximation of the value function of the energy stored in the seasonal storage at each time step. Using these bounds and value functions, we formulate a multistage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the total energy consumption of the system. In a numerical study based on a realistic system configuration, the proposed method is shown to operate the system close to global optimality.},

For systems with signiﬁcant seasonal imbalance between energy production and demand, it may be necessary to integrate seasonal storage in order to achieve fully decarbonized operation. This paper develops a novel model predictive control strategy for a renewable microgrid with seasonal hydrogen storage. The strategy relies on data-based prediction of the energy production and consumption of an industrial power plant and ﬁnds optimized energy ﬂows using a digital twin optimizer. To enable seasonal operation, incentives for long-term energy shifts are provided by assigning a cost value to the storage charge and adding it to the optimization target function. A hybrid control scheme based on rule-based heuristics compensates for imperfect predictions. With only 6\% oversizing compared to the optimal system layout, the strategy manages to deliver enough energy to meet all demand while achieving balanced hydrogen production and consumption throughout the year.},

We have developed a new numerical methodology to quantify the relevance of several electricity storage devices that would provide the required flexibility. First of all, through a signal analysis (wavelet decomposition) of photovoltaic power (PV), wind power and load time series, we study and characterize the intermittency at different time scales. Then, each storage technology is evaluated for each time scale from an energy return on investment (EROI) standpoint. They are also compared with the possibility of curtailing excess electricity instead of storing it. The relevance of a given technology especially depends on its efficiency and embodied energy. For instance, we show that batteries are not appropriate for long term storage because of their high embodied energy. However, they are a good choice for short term applications with high cycle requirements because of their efficiency. We characterize the relevance of storage devices, their sensitivity to the production mix and to technological characteristics. We point out that satisfying the energy demand of exceptional events only with storage devices requires an over-sizing of the whole system. It underlines the complementarity of energy storage with dispatchable electricity sources. We eventually show that seasonal electricity storage is particularly difficult to ensure with a good energy return on investment.},

	abstract = {Advanced building control strategies like model predictive control and reinforcement learning can consider forecasts for weather, occupancy, and energy prices. Combined with system and domain knowledge, this makes them a promising approach to reduce buildings’ energy consumption and CO2 emissions. For this reason, model predictive control and reinforcement learning have recently gained more popularity in the scientific literature. Nevertheless, publications often lack comparability among different control algorithms. The studies in the literature mainly focus on the comparison of an advanced algorithm with a conventional alternative. At the same time, use cases and key performance indicators vary strongly. This paper extensively evaluates six advanced control algorithms based on quantitative and qualitative key performance indicators. The considered control algorithms are a state-of-the-art model-free reinforcement learning algorithm (Soft-Actor-Critic), three model predictive controllers based on white-box, gray-box, and black-box modeling, approximate model predictive control, and a well-designed rule-based controller for fair benchmarking. The controllers are applied to an exemplary multi–input–multi–output building energy system and evaluated using a one-year simulation to cover seasonal effects. The considered building energy system is an office room supplied with heat and cold by an air handling unit and a concrete core activation. We consider the violation of air temperature constraints as thermal discomfort, the yearly energy consumption, and the computational effort as quantitative key performance indicators. Compared to the well-tuned rule-based controller, all advanced controllers decrease thermal discomfort. The black-box model predictive controller achieves the highest energy savings with 8.4\%, followed by the white-box model predictive controller with 7.4\% and the gray-box controller with 7.2\%. The reinforcement learning algorithm reduces energy consumption by 7.1\% and the approximate model predictive controller by 4.8\%. Next to these quantitative key performance indicators, we introduce qualitative criteria like adaptability, interpretability, and required know-how. Furthermore, we discuss the shortcomings and potential improvements of each controller.},
